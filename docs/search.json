I learned to set up processing recipes, and compare the performance of different ML models. The modelling techniques were used to examine relationships in the CAMELS hydrology dataset.\n ## Lab 6- Machine Learning - Tuning\nIn this lab, I built on my machine learning skills, tuning hyperparameter for increased model performance. I also learned how to compare the performance of different tunings, comparing them to split testing data, and overall optimize ML performance."
